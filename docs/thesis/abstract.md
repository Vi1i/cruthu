Terrain generation models are found across different industries and fields of study from geological and meteorological simulation to video games.

Current techniques assist in planning transportation networks, visualizing population migrations, conducting epidemiology research, and even teaching the new era of self-driving cars and drones.

Many current applications and research models are incredibly clever, generating realistic artifacts, e.g., trees, rivers, coastlines, populations, and even cities.

Unfortunately, most of these techniques are described and implemented separately.

They are not combined together to generate a complete realistic view or are not tested with other techniques.

This thesis proposes a model, Cruthú (Gaelic for "creation", pronounced cra-HU), that provides a novel platform allowing for complete world generation by integrating existing work from researchers.

The model is inspired by the Unix command-line pipeline where independent tools can be linked together to handle a complex task.

Cruthú proposes a similar approach.

To do this, we have investigated several industry standards to allow a generation "module" to present a robust unified application program interface.

Cruthú then uses dynamic loading and a pipelined architecture to generate a complete world.

Cruthú is also be highly modular, allowing components to be swapped in, swapped out, or re-ordered to achieve desired results.

We have built a prototype model that implements the main features, and further work  will allow for individual prototypes to be integrated together into a working system.[<sup>1</sup>](#1)
