Terrain generation models can be found in many different industries and fields of study from geological and meteorological simulation to video games.

Current techniques help researchers and organizations plan transportation networks, visualize population migrations, conduct epidemiology research, and even help teach the new era of self-driving cars and drones.

Many of the current applications and research models are incredibly clever and can generate realistic artifacts, e.g., trees, rivers, coastlines, populations, and even cities.

Unfortunately, most of these techniques are described and implemented separately.

They are not combined together to generate a complete realistic view or are not tested with other techniques.

This thesis proposes a model, Cruthú (Gaelic for ”creation”, pronounced cra-HU), that provides a novel platform allowing for complete world generation by integrating existing work from researchers.

The model is inspired by the Unix command-line pipeline where independent tools can be linked together to handle a complex task.

Cruthú proposes a similar approach.

To do this, we have investigated several industry standards to allow a generation ”module” to present a robust unified application program interface.

Cruthú then uses dynamic loading and a pipelined architecture togenerate a complete world.

Cruthú is also be highly modular, allowing modules to be swapped in, swapped out, or re-ordered to achieve desired results.

We have built a prototype model that implements the main features, and further work  will allow for individual prototypes to be integrated together into a working system.[<sup>1</sup>](#1)
